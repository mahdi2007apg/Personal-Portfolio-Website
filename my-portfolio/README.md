# Mahdi Mohammadi – Personal Portfolio

Minimalist personal website and digital portfolio built with Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.


## Current status (February 2026)

Homepage (hero + about section) is live in its first version:

- Hero with name, title, short tagline and social links
- About Me section highlighting:
  - Computer Science studies
  - Junior full-stack focus (Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy)
  - Structured learning path toward Master's abroad
  - Creative/hobby side (electronics, woodworking, music → future workshops & educational content)

UI heavily inspired by Brittany Chiang's portfolio (clean, dark-first aesthetic).

## Tech stack (current)

- Framework: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Icons: Custom SVG components + Lucide (planned)
- Deployment: Vercel

## Next milestones – short-term roadmap

These are the concrete next steps I'm actively working on (ordered by priority):

1. **Make the site fully responsive**  
   - Mobile-first adjustments  
   - Proper desktop layout (wider content, better spacing, multi-column where appropriate)  
   - Test on 320–1920px viewports

2. **Add smooth subtle animations & micro-interactions**  
   - Fade-in on scroll (Framer Motion)  
   - Hover states on links, tags, cards  
   - Entrance animations for sections (very restrained – no over-the-top effects)

3. **Implement dark/light mode toggle**  
   - Persistent theme preference (localStorage + system preference)  
   - Using Zustand for theme state  
   - Smooth transition between modes

4. **Create the three main content pages/sections**  
   - `/profession` → Projects & Development work  
     (full-stack projects with screenshots, tech stack, GitHub & live links)  
   - `/academia` → Studies, courses, certifications, achievements, academic goals  
     (especially important for Master's applications abroad)  
   - `/polymath` → Creative & making side  
     (electronics builds, woodworking projects, music, future workshops & teaching plans)

5. **Navigation & layout improvements**  
   - Persistent top navigation (or sidebar on desktop) linking to the three main areas  
   - Better typography scale & spacing system  
   - Consistent section padding & max-width container

6. **Polish & small quality-of-life additions**  
   - Favicon + proper metadata (title, description, og:image)  
   - Contact form (optional – using server actions or Formspree/Resend)  
   - 404 page & basic error handling

## Why this structure?

The site is intentionally built around **three main cards/areas** after the hero:

- **Profession** → shows I can build real full-stack applications  
- **Academia** → documents serious, structured learning + clear Master's goals abroad  
- **Polymath** → honestly represents creative hobbies & multi-dimensional interests

This division helps different audiences quickly find what matters to them (recruiters, professors, immigration officers, collaborators, makers).

## Contributing / Feedback

This is a personal project, but I'm open to civil, constructive feedback — especially about:

- accessibility (contrast, semantics, screen reader experience)
- UX on mobile
- clarity of the immigration/academic narrative

Feel free to open an issue if you spot something broken or have suggestions.
